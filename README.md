# updater_self_dev

Welcome to the first release of the Game File Updater! This tool is designed to update files stored on your computer, which can include game files or any other types of files that require regular updates.

The updater works by comparing the local versions of your files with the versions available on a server. If it detects any discrepancies, it automatically downloads the updated files from the server, ensuring that your files are always up to date.

After several days of development, I am excited to present the first version of this updater. It's a straightforward and efficient solution to keep your files in sync with the latest updates.

Feel free to try it out, contribute, and share your feedback for future improvements!
